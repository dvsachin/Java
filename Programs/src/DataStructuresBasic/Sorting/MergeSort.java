 * Divide and Conquer Algorithm (divide, conquer and merge)
 * stable algorithm
 * TC = theta(n logn) , SC = O(n)
 * well suited for linked lists, works in O(1) space
 * used in external sorting
 * in general, for arrays quicksort (better) outperforms
 * variant of merge sort is block merge sort which will give theta(n logn) , SC = O(1)
 * python uses variation of merge sort tim sort (merge + insertion)
